Find a book nearby and look at the back. There, you’ll most often see a barcode with 13 digits underneath. The job of the last digit is to check whether an error has occurred in the other 12. If there has been an error, the cashier has to scan the item again — but that’s far better than accidentally registering a carton of cream when it was supposed to be milk.
